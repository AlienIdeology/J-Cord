# J-Cord
A Discord API Wrapper for Java <br />

## Features
- Events Handling and Dispatching
  - Exception Events and Handling
- Native Emoji Support
- Ugh... isn't this "another JDA but very crappier"? <br />
(Think about this as a unwrapped, not documented, and hard coded JDA)
- Not much static abuse... **yet**.

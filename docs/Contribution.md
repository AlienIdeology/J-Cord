## Pull Request
Please feel free and pull requests! If you have any enhancements or new ideas to the repository,
just submit a pull request! Here are some stuff to take note of:
1. Please add Javadocs and inline documentations. Javadocs are required for any java files that
 are not in the `internal` package. Inline documentations may only be presented to a class, abstract class,
 enumeration, or a default method in an interface.
2. If part of the pull request is not finished, please add a todo `// TODO: [Todo stuff here]` stating
 the current status.
3. Coding style: Tabs should be 4 spaces long. The bracket style should follow
 [1 TBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS_.28OTBS.29), which the opening brackets
 are located at the end of a line.
4. All objects (not internal) should have getters and setters.
